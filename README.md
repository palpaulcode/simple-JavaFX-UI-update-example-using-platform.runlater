# simple-JavaFX-UI-update-example-using-platform.runlater
updating a javafx ui can be difficult. the program requires the programmer to use thread Platform.runLater(). 
the UI update is then executed from within this thread. thats what this program showcases using a very simple example of
a clock whose content has to be updated every second
